# The Open Plato Project

Welcome to the Open Plato Project, an unassuming attempt to make Plato's dialogues accessible to all. We are in the project's earliest days and are seeking input and help from lovers of wisdom everywhere. Our long-term hopes include:
- Putting Plato online in the original Greek and multiple modern translations, in a beautiful, readable format
- Seamlessly annotating the text with explanatory notes and links to relevant scholarly literature
- Creating a syntopicon of the ideas and themes found in the dialogues, allowing users to browse selections by theme
- Developing a rich wiki of the people, places, myths, etc., referenced by Plato
